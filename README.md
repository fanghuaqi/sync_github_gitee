# Sync Projects from Github to Gitee

[![Sync Github and Gitee](https://github.com/fanghuaqi/sync_github_gitee/actions/workflows/sync.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/fanghuaqi/sync_github_gitee/actions/workflows/sync.yml)

This repo is mainly used to sync projects from **github.com** to **gitee.com**.

> [!WARNING]
> **llvm-project** and **linux** repo sync are ignored since blocked by gitee due to repo size reason.

* [gitee.com](https://gitee.com/) is based in China, which provide good access speed, so mirror to [gitee.com](https://gitee.com/) is neccessary.
* [github.com](https://github.com/) access speed in China is not good
