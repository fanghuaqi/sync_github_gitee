# Sync Projects from Github to Gitee

[![Sync Github and Gitee](https://github.com/fanghuaqi/sync_github_gitee/workflows/Sync%20Github%20and%20Gitee/badge.svg)](https://github.com/fanghuaqi/sync_github_gitee/actions)

This repo is mainly used to sync projects from **github.com** to **gitee.com**.

* [gitee.com](https://gitee.com/) is based in China, which provide good access speed, so mirror to [gitee.com](https://gitee.com/) is neccessary.
* [github.com](https://github.com/) access speed in China is not good
